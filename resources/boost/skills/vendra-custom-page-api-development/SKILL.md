# Vendra Custom Page API

## Workflow

- Inspect `composer.json`, sibling files, and existing tests before changing the package.
- Use Laravel Boost `application-info` and `search-docs` before code changes.
- Apply `laravel-best-practices` to Laravel PHP and `pest-testing` whenever tests change.
- Apply `tailwindcss-development` only when changing Blade markup or Tailwind classes.
- Keep changes inside this package's boundary and preserve its public contracts.
- Add or update focused Pest coverage, then run `php artisan test --compact --testsuite=vendra-custom-page-api` and `composer stan`.

Use this skill together with `laravel-best-practices` and `pest-testing`.

## Translatable Persistence

- Making a persisted model field translatable is an explicit domain choice unless this package already requires it.
- Every field listed in a model's `$translatable` array must definitely use a JSON database column. Keep its model traits/casts, factories, validation, Filament locale UI, API serialization, and tests translation-aware.
- A field not listed in `$translatable` must use the appropriate scalar database type and must not use Spatie Translatable, translatable slug traits, locale switchers, translated callbacks, or translation-shaped array data.

## Vendra Transitive API Policy

- Treat a Vendra dependency intentionally exposed through the public API of a directly required Vendra platform package as part of the supported public contract of that package.
- Do not add a redundant direct Composer requirement solely because source code imports a type from that exposed dependency.
- Apply this only to Vendra platform packages listed under `require`; never extend it to `require-dev`, `suggest`, incidental implementation dependencies, or third-party packages. Removing or replacing an exposed dependency is a breaking change; keep `self.version` alignment across the Vendra package graph.

## Module Boundary

- Keep API code in `packages/vendra-custom-page-api` under `Misaf\VendraCustomPageApi`.
- Depend on `Misaf\VendraCustomPage` models; do not duplicate models, migrations, factories, policies, or Filament UI.
- Inherit tenant scoping from domain models and never reference `Misaf\VendraTenant` in production code.
- Do not require `misaf/vendra-localization` or attach `vendra.locale`; the host application owns optional locale resolution.

## API Platform Contract

- Expose read models as API Platform resources in `src/ApiResource` (`CustomPageResource`, `CustomPageCategoryResource`), backed by `ContentResourceProvider` in `src/State`.
- Keep the `/content/custom-pages` and `/content/custom-page-categories` resources read-only.
- Expose translated JSON columns as `array<string, string>` locale maps and hydrate them from the domain models' translations in the state provider.
- Declare supported query parameters as `QueryParameter`s on the resource operations, using API Platform filters (`EqualsFilter`, `BooleanFilter`, ...) with Laravel `constraints`.
- Reference the domain models' multimedia and category relations with `Misaf\VendraApi\ApiResource\ResourceReference` instead of embedding foreign models.
- Apply every declared parameter inside the state provider when building the Eloquent query.

## Verification

- Test each resource operation, its query parameters, and architecture.
- Run package Pest tests, PHPStan, Composer validation, and Pint.
